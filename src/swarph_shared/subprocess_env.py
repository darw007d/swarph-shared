"""Subprocess env scrubbing for `claude -p` (and any other subprocess that
must NOT inherit billing-path env keys).

**SCOPE — read carefully**: this denylist guards the BILLING PATH only —
keeping `claude -p` on subscription auth (`~/.claude/.credentials.json`)
instead of metered API. It does NOT cover general secret-leakage concerns.
As of the 2026-06-01 adversarial-sweep CRIT, this now ALSO catches the
billing/auth-REDIRECT class — the ``*_AUTH_TOKEN`` and ``*_BASE_URL`` suffixes
plus explicit GCP/Vertex creds — which flip ``claude -p`` (and the other
subscription CLIs) from subscription auth to a metered/relay endpoint while
cost_usd still reports 0.0. Other secret shapes (OPENAI_BEARER, OAUTH_*,
*_SECRET) remain out of scope — this is the BILLING denylist, not a general
secret-leak allowlist.

When new billing-relevant key shapes appear, add them to
``FORBIDDEN_KEYS_EXPLICIT`` here.

Pattern is the explicit named set UNION the `*_API_KEY` suffix — denylist
not allowlist by design. Allowlist would be stronger for general-secret-leak
prevention but would break the moment `claude -p` (or any other subprocess)
needed an env var we didn't anticipate (PYTHONPATH, NPM_CONFIG_*, locale
vars, etc.). For the BILLING use case, denylist is correct.

The audit memory: anything ending in ``_API_KEY`` is force-popped; the
explicit set catches keys that don't end in `_API_KEY` but ARE billing-
relevant. Denylist composition: explicit_set ∪ `*_API_KEY` suffix.

Reference for the rule + audit lineage:
- CLAUDE.md "Critical operational rules" — "Lab-side daemons run
  subscription-billed via `claude -p`, NEVER anthropic.Anthropic() SDK.
  Setting ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in claude-service env would silently flip the
  billing path."
- evolution_tracker ev_an040i00v — primitive #7 `config-leak-via-env-
  inheritance` filed 2026-05-07, lab+claude-service both had the
  wholesale-passthrough bug
- DM #595/#596 review: lab+drop converged on denylist-with-suffix (not
  allowlist) as the right shape for the billing scope

    Defensive: pops anything ending in ``_API_KEY`` (forward-compat) plus an
    explicit set of known billing keys. Preserves PATH, HOME, USER, etc. so
    subscription-billed subprocesses (``claude -p``) can find their
    credentials file and runtime deps.

    Use case:
